                    Milk steaming and latte art are two essential skills for any barista. Neither are easy to master, especially when you first start, but I’ve got good news for you: choosing the right milk pitcher can significantly help.

                    The moka pot is a stove-top or electric coffee maker that brews coffee by passing boiling water pressurised by steam through ground coffee. Named after the Yemeni city of Mocha, it was invented by Italian engineer Alfonso Bialetti in 1933 and quickly became one of the staples of Italian culture. Bialetti Industries continues to produce the same model under the trade name "Moka Express".

                    A French press, also known as a cafetière, cafetière à piston, caffettiera a stantuffo, press pot, coffee press, or coffee plunger, is a coffee brewing device, although it can also be used for other tasks. In 1923 Ugo Paolini, an Italian, lodged patent documents relating to a tomato juice separator and he developed the idea of making a coffee pot with a press action and a filter. He assigned his 1928 patent to Italian designer Attilio Calimani and Giulio Moneta who filed it in 1929.

                    An espresso machine brews coffee by forcing pressurized water near boiling point through a "puck" of ground coffee and a filter in order to produce a thick, concentrated coffee called espresso. The first machine for making espresso was built and patented in 1884 by Angelo Moriondo of Turin, Italy. An improved design was patented on 28 April 1903 by Luigi Bezzera.

                    The uniform particle size and variable settings of a burr grinder[4] make it well-suited for coffee preparation, as different methods of coffee preparation require different size grinds. The size of the grind is determined by the width between the two burrs, into which the coffee beans fall and are ground a few at a time.
